      Kirje Attendence is helpful in tracking the Attendence of the employee in an accurate manner.
      It tracks the physical presence of the employee by tracking the mobile phone of the employee
      with enabled bluetooth. It solves the miss punch problem by matching the physical presence of
      of employee along with its punched information from the biometric machine. If there is a missmatch,
      then it notifies the user with the help of push notification in the mobile phone of the user, and
      user punches again in the biometrics in order to make the correction.
